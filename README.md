These projects aim to put into practice the knowledge acquired in XML and semantic web to structure and manipulate data. The main objective is to use XML, a markup language, to organize information hierarchically and facilitate their exchange between different systems. The semantic web, on the other hand, aims to give meaning to data by linking them to ontologies and allowing automated interpretation. Thanks to these projects, it will be possible to manipulate and exploit data efficiently, facilitating their search, integration and analysis.
